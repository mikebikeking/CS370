**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
I was given most the code for this project. I created the code for the Q-Training Algorithm section.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

Computer scientists are the architects of the digital world, designing, developing, and analyzing software and hardware systems to solve problems and create innovative solutions. Their work spans a vast range of fields, from artificial intelligence and cybersecurity to data science and game development. The impact of computer science is pervasive in modern society, powering the technologies we rely on daily, from smartphones and social media to medical devices and autonomous vehicles. Computer scientists play a crucial role in driving technological advancements, improving efficiency, and enhancing our quality of life.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

Computer scientists approach problems systematically by first understanding the problem's scope and desired outcome. They then break the problem down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. For each subproblem, they develop an algorithm or a series of steps to solve it. Next, they implement the algorithm using a suitable programming language. To ensure accuracy and efficiency, they thoroughly test the code, identifying and fixing errors. Finally, they refine the solution to optimize performance and efficiency.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

Computer scientists have a significant ethical responsibility to the end-user and the organization. Key ethical considerations include protecting user data and handling it responsibly, safeguarding systems from unauthorized access, avoiding biases in algorithms and data to prevent discrimination, being transparent about the workings of systems and their potential limitations, considering the broader societal implications of technology, and adhering to professional standards and ethical guidelines. By understanding these responsibilities, computer scientists can create technology that benefits society while minimizing harm.
